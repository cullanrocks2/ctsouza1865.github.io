		  <p> All images contained on all pages of the website have alternative text that will display 
		  in the event that they do not load properly. The functionality of links remains basic in that 
		  they all work as intended without need for any javascript. I was receiving contrast errors on 
		  all pages due to the background-image and the white text color. To remedy this, I added a background 
		  color to my <divs> and made them slightly opaque so that the image could still be seen behind them, but 
		  still provide enough of a black backdrop to read the text if the image did not load properly. Any discrete links 
		  have roll-over color to indicate that there is a link present.
