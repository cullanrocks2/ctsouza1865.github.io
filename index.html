			Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Cullan Souza. At the time this website was created,
			I was a full-time student at Florida Gulf Coast University pursuing a dregree in Software Engineering. 
			On this website, you'll be able to learn more about me personally, what my passions are, and what sort 
			of classes and projects I have done related to computer science. Please use the navigation bar above to 
			explore what my website has to offer! If you're strictly interested in a quick glance I would suggest taking
